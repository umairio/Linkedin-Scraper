AI-native startup
founded by engineers who have actually shipped complex products before. Our CEO has a long software career — from coding to leading hundreds — and together with our current tech lead, created
DataDive.tools
, one of the most widely used SaaS platforms for Amazon sellers.
We’re now applying that same product discipline to a mobile app that blends
AI reasoning, real-world sensors, and structured UX
into something genuinely new. The first use case is our own best seller baking brand, but the underlying framework can power a new generation of
AI-driven mobile apps for physical-product companies
. This is the ground floor of something
technically challenging, fast-moving, and real
.
🧠 Backend Engineer (Node / NestJS)
Why This Role Matters
You’ll help build the backbone of Superbaking — the service layer that turns messy real-life inputs (photos, notes, goals) into structured, actionable insights. Our backend uses
NestJS + TypeScript + MongoDB
, wired to an
AI orchestration layer
with strict, schema-first contracts. Clean design, type safety, and clarity matter more here than frameworks or buzzwords.
Must-Haves
2+ years of professional experience with
Node.js / TypeScript
Solid grasp of async flows, error handling, and modular design
Ability to design
clean REST APIs
(resources, status codes, pagination)
Comfort with
MongoDB
data modeling and queries
Writes readable, small functions with early returns and strict typing (no any)
Unit-testing experience (
Jest
, Arrange–Act–Assert)
Clear written communication (PRs, docs, commit messages)
Nice-to-Have / Learn-on-the-Job
NestJS
patterns (modules, DI, providers)
Validation & DTOs (class-validator, Zod, TypeORM/Mongoose)
OpenAI API
integrations and structured JSON outputs
CI/CD (GitHub Actions), Docker, basic AWS (Lightsail/Secrets)
Relational databases (MySQL/ PostgreSQL).
What You’ll Do
Build and extend endpoints for core entities
Add schema-validated writes and utilities for Profile / Preferences / State
Write focused unit and integration tests; refactor for maintainability
Keep the backend predictable, typed, and stable as the app grows
How We Work
Schema-first contracts
and single-envelope responses — every output explicit
Testing discipline:
sandbox vs production workflows
Code review before debugging:
clarity beats cleverness
🌍 Work Environment & Culture
We’re a highly technical team that values clarity, autonomy, and craftsmanship. We operate with
radical transparency
and live by our core values:
personal responsibility, direct honesty, bidirectional loyalty, fairness, ambition, continuous improvement, an action-oriented mindset, and data-driven rational thinking.
We move fast — not chaotically — with strong respect for design, testing, and clean architecture. Startup energy meets engineering discipline: perfect for those who love solving hard problems without bureaucracy.
💬 Communication & Collaboration
We communicate in
English
, primarily via Slack and Notion. Meetings are short and purposeful; most decisions are documented asynchronously. Code reviews are thoughtful and technical — if you can explain
why
your code exists, not just
what
it does, you’ll thrive here.
🚀 Career Growth & Exposure
You’ll work directly with leaders who built
DataDive.tools
, gaining exposure to real product strategy and large-scale AI integration. We’re already developing a second major product — an
E-commerce Performance Analytics platform
— so there’s room to expand into new domains and technologies.
🧭 Our Approach to AI
We use AI everywhere — from generating type-safe scaffolding to analyzing prompts — but never on autopilot. At Superbaking, AI is a
power tool
, not a substitute for thinking. We expect engineers to understand, challenge, and refine what the model suggests. If you want to
learn faster without losing ownership
of your code and decisions, you’ll fit right in.
⚙️ Contract Details
Type:
Long-term contract (no expiration)
Remuneration:
Weekly tax-free remittance of gross amount
Paid Time Off:
Eligible after 3 months (8.08 % of worked hours, cash-out anytime)
Work Mode:
Fully remote OR in person, depending on location; flexible hours
Reports To:
Technical Team Lead
🔎 Hiring Process
Automated Test
– short fundamentals screen
Work Test
– realistic task similar to our production work
Interview
– technical and culture fit discussion with the Team Lead (and sometimes the CEO)
✨ Summary
We’re building an
AI-native ecosystem
that redefines how physical-product brands interact with users — starting with baking, expanding to analytics, and powered by a team that loves to code. If you think in systems, write with care, and want to grow faster than most environments allow, you’ll fit right in.
